# VueJS Random User Project

Welcome to my first VueJS project! This simple web application allows users to fetch random user data and dynamically change the background color based on the gender of the retrieved user. I've utilized the CDN version of VueJS to build this project.

## Project Features

- **Get Random User**: Clicking the "Get Random User" button triggers an API call to fetch random user data.

- **Dynamic Background Color**: The background color changes dynamically based on the gender of the retrieved user. Blue is used for male users, and pink is used for female users.

## Technologies Used

- VueJS: I used the CDN version of VueJS to build this project.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Open the project directory in your code editor.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

4. Click the "Get Random User" button to see the magic happen!

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.

- `styles.css`: The stylesheet containing the styles for the web page, including the dynamic background color logic.

- `app.js`: The main JavaScript file where the VueJS application is initialized and the random user fetching logic is implemented.

## API Used

I used the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) to fetch random user data.
